## Evoogle.Core

Evoogle Core is a foundational library of C# extensions and other foundational C# components such as:

- **Cloneable**. Deep clone framework with the following built-in implementations available:
  - JSON serialization/deserialization of the source object to create a deep clone of the source object.
- **NTree**. N-Ary tree library.

## Evoogle.XUnit

Evoogle XUnit is a unit testing library using the features of the excellent [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) library to standardize unit testing by defining abstractions/implementations of unit test classes that break the unit test down into the following fundamental steps of a unit test:

- *Arrange*
- *Act*
- *Assert*
